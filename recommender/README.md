<!-- ## About The Project -->
<h2 style='margin-bottom: 5px;'> About The Project </h2> 
<h5 style='margin-top: 0px;'> AS 91901: Apply user experience methodologies to develop a design for a digital technologies outcome  </h4>

Content Recommender is the project I have been working on for the Project Management NZCEA Level 3 standard. I started the project on 26th August and finished on the 10th October


#### Problem Statement

Recommender systems are commonly recognised as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. 

“In October 2006, Netflix released a dataset containing 100 million anonymous movie ratings and challenged the data mining, machine learning and computer science communities to develop systems that could beat the accuracy of its recommendation system, Cinematch” (Bennett & Lanning, 2007). 
Given a dataset of movies or music albums, users and their ratings, you are to create a recommender system. 


### Built With

* Java (Maven Project)
* ECS100 Library
* UiBooster Library
